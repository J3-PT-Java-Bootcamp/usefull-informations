<br>

CodeWars is a platform created to improve programming skills through challenges called **katas** and community support.

It is a collective resource where programmers from all over the world create, improve and solve kata challenges. All kata solutions are also opensourced and it is a great resource to improve your coding skills.

Are you ready?

## Create a codeWars account

First things first: create your account. The easiest way to do it is to use your GitHub account.

1. Go to [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/)
2. Select Java as your programming language
3. After you select your language, you will have to solve and submit a couple of mini exercises to prove you understand Java (fun is beginning!)
4. When you pass the initiation, you will receive this message _'You have passed the initiation. Now the real training begins...'_ and then you'll fill out a form with some personal info.
5. Link your GitHub account, indicate your email, and click on 'Enlist'.
6. Log into your new account

## Ironhack Clan

Once you created your account, you should join the Ironhack Clan in Codewars.

Go to your [Account Settings](https://www.codewars.com/users/edit) and add `j3pt-ironhack` to your **Clan field**

Now if you go to your **Profile Page**, you should see all your Ironhack Clan members in the social tab.

When you enter the site, you will find your dashboard.

<br>

At the top of the screen, CodeWars will suggest a challenge that you can accept by clicking on the 'Train' button. If you prefer another exercise, click on 'Skip'.

It also specifies where you are at any time.

## Your first CodeWars kata

Go to your first kata, [even-or-odd](https://www.codewars.com/kata/even-or-odd).

<br>

<br>

In this view, you will find:

1. **The name of the kata** 'Even or Odd'.
2. **Some details about the kata** (satisfaction rating, number of collections where this kata is used, etc). Hover your mouse over the statistics to see more information.
3. **The programming language** If your account is set to be in Java, it is preselected. However, you can change it to solve it in another language (not now).
4. **The Details tab** is preselected and the Description of the kata is shown. You will find instructions for completing the kata here.
5. **The Solutions tab** Before you submit your work, the solution will be hidden. If you choose to view the solutions you will forfeit your eligibility to earn honor/rank progress for the kata.
6. **The Forks tab**. Will be also available after you complete the kata.
7. **The Discourse tab** is a great place to submit your questions. In fact, you can also read other programmers' Q&As. Maybe your answer is there or maybe your able to answer a question. Participate! This will help you to get more points!
8. To solve this kata click on the **Train** button.

## Solving the kata

<br>

In the solving page you will find a whole environment to practice. Instructions and Output will be on the left side of the screens and you can swap between tags to see any of them.

On the right side of the screen you write your Solution code. Also, tests are available for you to apply TDD or to see if your code actually works. 

After you finish coding, click on **Run Suite**. This will execute the tests and check if your solution is right.

The Output tab will show if you passed or failed the tests. When you pass them, the **Run Suite** will become **Submit Final**, click on it.

When you submit your code, the Solutions tag will be unblocked and you will be able to see other solutions. Read some of them.

## Earning the points

<br>

<br>

In the [CodeWars documentation](https://www.codewars.com/docs) you, will find a description of their point system. You'll need a lot of points to become a master. At first, you will be a `8kyu` coder. As you might already noticed, punctuation system and exercises classification are inspired in [Karate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karate).

Go to **your profile** and check your stats. Here you will find information about your current state and how to improve to the next level!

As you know from before, completing katas, authoring and translating katas, commenting, posting solutions and receiving referrals are activities that grant honor (points) for the user. Be proactive and participate in the community!
